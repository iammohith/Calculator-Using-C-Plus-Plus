# Calculator Using C++

## About
This repository contains a simple calculator program written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a great starting point for beginners who are learning C++ programming and want to understand control flow using `switch` statements.

## Features
- Supports four basic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Handles invalid operator input and division by zero.
- Provides clear output for each operation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler such as GCC or an IDE that supports C++ (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).
  
### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iammohith/Calculator-Using-C-Plus-Plus.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Calculator-Using-C-Plus-Plus
   ```
3. Compile the C++ program using a compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
   ```

4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./calculator
   ```

### How to Use
1. Enter an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
2. Provide two numbers to perform the operation.
3. The calculator will output the result or an error message if the input is invalid (e.g., division by zero).

### Example
```
Enter operator either + or - or * or /: +
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
5 + 3 = 8
```
